          <p><b><i>Denzel is of West African descent (his parents are from Sierra Leone and Liberia), although you would probably never be able to realize this if it wasn't mentioned because of his American name. Like most geeks, Denzel considers himself to be a tech-savvy, highly ambitious individual with aspirations to become a well established software architect as well as a product designer. He also has extended interests in hardware technologies and systems due to his primary learning styles, which are visual and hands-on. Denzel loves learning about new concepts and applying innovative ideas to practical real-world problems. All of these things can explain why Denzel chose to pursue a degree in Computer Science.</b></i> <a href="https://twitter.com/jasonlong">Theme by Jason Long</a>.</p></b></i>
